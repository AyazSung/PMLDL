    "# Practical Machine Learning and Deep Learning - Assignment 1 - Text De-toxification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task description\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Detoxification Task is a process of transforming the text with toxic style into the text with the same meaning but with neutral style.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Formal definition of text detoxification task can be found in [Text Detoxification using Large Pre-trained Neural Models by Dale et al., page 14](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08914)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to create a solution for detoxing text with high level of toxicity.\n",
    " It can be a model or set of models, or any algorithm that would work. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Level of Toxicity is labeled with annotating binary classification by people.\n",
    " Text is passed to annotators for them to put specific label toxic/non-toxic.\n",
    " Then number of positive / toxic assesments are divided by the total number of annotators.\n",
    " This process is performed for every entry in the data, resulting in toxicity dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this process, we have text with toxicity level.\n",
    " However, for training the model it is best to have sample with high toxicity level and its paraphrazed version with low toxicity level.\n",
    " This gives an opportunity for the model to distiguish from the overall meaning of the text and concentrate on decreasing the level of toxicity (during the training process).\n",
    " That is why the data that is provided for you has the pair structure.\n",
    " Dataset structure is described in next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a subset of the ParaNMT corpus (50M sentence pairs). The filtered ParaNMT-detox corpus (500K sentence pairs) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/skoltech-nlp/detox/releases/download/emnlp2021/filtered_paranmt.zip). This is the main dataset for the assignment detoxification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is given in the `.tsv` format, means columns are separated by `\\t` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column | Type | Discription | \n",
    "| ----- | ------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| reference | str | First item from the pair | \n",
    "| ref_tox | float | toxicity level of reference text | \n",
    "| translation | str | Second item from the pair - paraphrazed version of the reference|\n",
    "| trn_tox | float | toxicity level of translation text |\n",
    "| similarity | float | cosine similarity of the texts |\n",
    "| lenght_diff | float | relative length difference between texts |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation criterias\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is on creating the solution, not on evaluating your algorithm. Major part of the grade will be dedicated to the structure of the solution, your development choices and your explonation on how you approached the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission should be a link to GitHub repository. It should be open repository, so that the course team could assess it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the repository should has the following structure:\n",
